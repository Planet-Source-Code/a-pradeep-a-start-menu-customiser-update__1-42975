This is an update for the older version of madness, again i take no responsibility for this code 
you are free to manipulate this or even claim credit, there might be some problems with the design part, please rate my two codes so that i can send you the final release of madness along with huge help files which fixes the hide drives function and opens many more options.
this one uses the same module ( i didnt code it, it's a great code though but i am looking for a module which can delete rename and copy keys and specially values).

p.s -- >I completed the binary patcher which can detect and change labels in any executable file, it can change labels of start menu and it's contents, it is coded in Turbo C 2.0, soon i'll get it to XP if i get enough response.
